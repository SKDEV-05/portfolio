# Portfolio Updates - Final Polish ✨

## ✅ Social Media Project Updated

- **Removed Video**: Replaced with an image slider (Swiper) just like the E-commerce project.
- **Added Images**: Now showcases multiple screenshots (`social1`, `social2`, `chat`) in a clean slider.
- **Consistent UI**: All projects now share a unified, professional look.

## ✅ "Stacking Cards" Scroll Effect Added

- **Sticky Projects**: As you scroll down, projects now **stack on top of each other**.
- **Parallax Feel**: The new project slides up and covers the old one.
- **Smooth Transition**: Added shadow and background to create a depth effect.
- **Mobile Optimized**: On mobile, it reverts to normal scrolling for better usability.

## ✅ Previous Fixes (Confirmed)

- **Arabic Skills**: Skills now scroll correctly and are fully visible in Arabic mode.
- **Translations**: "Saad Korma" and "I'm" are correctly translated in all languages.
- **Loading Screen**: Restored and working.
- **Swimming Icons**: Visible on top layer.
